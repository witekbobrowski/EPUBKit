/// This service handles the extraction of EPUB files, which are essentially ZIP archives
/// containing structured XHTML content, metadata, and resources. According to the EPUB
/// specification (Section 3.3), an EPUB file must be a ZIP-based OCF (Open Container Format)
/// archive.
///
/// The service uses the Zip library to handle the extraction process and ensures that
/// files with the `.epub` extension are recognized as valid ZIP archives.

    /// 2. Uses Zip.quickUnzipFile to extract all contents to a temporary directory
    /// 3. Returns the URL of the extraction directory
    ///
    /// The temporary directory is managed by the system and will be cleaned up
    /// automatically when no longer needed.
